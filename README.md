## File Storage

Work-in-progress app for simple file storage/sharing. Located at [files.mateimarica.dev](https://files.mateimarica.dev). Access is  granted on request because space is limited.

Key features:
- The ability to set a download limit and validity period for a shared file.
- The ability to create a file-request link with a validity period and file size limit.
- A notes interface that will sync on multiple devices as you type.

***Note:** The feedback form was formerly a "complaint form" to be comical. The live feedback section on the website has also been removed for professional reasons. However, the API endpoint is still live â€” if you can find it.*
